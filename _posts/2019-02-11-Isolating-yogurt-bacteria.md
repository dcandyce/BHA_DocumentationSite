#### Isolating yogurt bacteria and a small workshop in Ardunio

![Solutions]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lab%20work/Isolating20%bacteria.jpg)

Today we prepared the medium to isolate yogurt bacteria.
Tomorrow we'll get round to doing the plating and diluting

We also did a basic workshop in Ardunio today : a simple circuit to see temperature

I have decided to make an incubator so will use this basic circuit that is used to test temp and a starting point to understand the electronics surrounding the incubator.  (will be using the one on the BHA Github as a starting point)

Mischa and I tried to put a DC motor into the circuit we had, without using an extra source of power (the DC motor needs 9V) but something went wrong and we didn't get around to trouble shooting the issue - hopefully will have some time this week to have a tinker
