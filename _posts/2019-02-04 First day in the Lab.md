# How to prepare and grow bacteria

Today  we were taught how to prepare a nutrient agar in a sterile environment and how to inoculate it with a bacteria JL.

_its important to remember to prepare a 'non-selective' nutrient in a sterile environment to ensure only the bacteria you inoculate it with will grow on the surface_

* Step 1
Measure the correct nutrient agar needed to grow your bacteria

* Step 2
Autoclave the mixed media.
This is to make sure the nutrients are sterile

* Step 3
Wipe down your surface with 70% ethanol
Use a flame to create a 'sterile umbrella'. This will ensure a Â±30 cm radius around the flame is sterile.

* Step 4
Pouring the nutrients into the petri dishes, you need to make sure it is always done within the sterile zone.
_its a good idea to write the labels on the bottom side before starting the work. this makes it easier and quicker_

* Step 5
To inoculate the nutrients you spread the bacteria with an inoculation loop spreading it in a zigzag pattern.

* Step 6
Seal it with parafilm, making sure its labeled with _contents : date : name_
