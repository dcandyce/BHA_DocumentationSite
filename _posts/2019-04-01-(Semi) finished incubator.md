I realised that I don't really need the electronics to work for the current use of my incubator - it's warm enough inside to keep a constant temperature inside for the plants to grow.

I will still work toward getting the electronics working when I'm back in London. I think the best thing for me to do is to buy an analog thermometer and try that with the shield - hopefully this will work!
I look forward to making version 2 : full working incubator that takes less than 3 weeks to make.
