I have decided that i want to continue with my work here and realised i need to set up the environment to allow me to pursue this.
A reason I have to go to Amsterdam to do the BioHack Academy is because there is not place in London that offers a space to do this.
I have been in conversation with a few places where they have an interest and space to possibly set up a lab for me to use and to allow others to use it as a creative place to explore biology and make art.

I plan to keep this blog alive with updates on my personal project of growing plant tissue, but also to keep those interested in setting up a lab up to date.
