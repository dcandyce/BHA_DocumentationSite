#### Documenting my growth experiments


![Photoshoot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/project work/photoshoot.JPG)


I'd like to find a good system to document the growth on my plants and different experiments in a way thats easy for me track and look back at.
I am using a lab notebook to keep track of the protocol changes I have made in my experiments but after taking photos of my experiments I realised there is such a wealth of visual reference here and I'd like to use the visual side of it as a tool too.

I'm not sure what it will be yet but i'd like to create a data base that is sharable and accessable to those who wish to explore plant tissue culture too.
