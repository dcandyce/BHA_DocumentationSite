#### UPDATE OF GROWTH AND NEW SEEDS

**Cauliflower growth week 2**
I think I was a bit to fast to throw away a few of my previous petri dishes and tubes that 'looked' contaminated.
Above is a shot of some growth! this was from the first batch i made a few weeks back.
New leaves have began to sprout and some pieces are growing roots.

**Using seeds that haven't been sterilised**
I wanted to know what happened if I used seeds that weren't sterile - this growth took around 2 days!
Good to know there is a real reason to sterilise the tissue before placing it on the medium.

**Growing Tobacco seeds**
In on protocol I read through they began their experiment by growing the plant from seed and said that tobacco was best as its pretty hardy and grows fast.
I decided, as i made so many MS dishes to experiment with this would be a good use of at least 3.
I first sterilised the seeds but placing them in a bowl, in the sterile hood and pouring 70% ethanol over it.
I did this 3 times, each time waiting Â±20min for the ethanol to dry.
I then stored them in  sterile petri dish for safe keeping.
As they are super tiny seeds one needs to be careful when sterilising them, which is why I chose to do it on tissue paper and ethanol rather than spraying or soaking them as I did with the other seeds.
