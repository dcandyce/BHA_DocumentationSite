title: Understanding the mould growth
---

From the experiment i did a few weeks back there seems to be quite a few results, one major one being mould.

At first I assumed the mould was growing just on the pineapple - maybe i didn't sterilised the tissue i had collected well enough, maybe it was too much coconut water or liquid fertiliser?
After a few days of keeping an eye on the other samples I made I noticed that the same type of mould was growing in dishes with a different media.
But it had also started to grow on the daffodil tissue that I had 'planted' and nothing showed up in the test tubes, only the petri dishes.

I still dont know what could've caused this but have left them to see what develops.
The one dish, that contained non sterilised seeds, moulded over. I decided to leave this alongside the other seeds to see if anything will come from it -  there are currently two little sprouts coming up!
