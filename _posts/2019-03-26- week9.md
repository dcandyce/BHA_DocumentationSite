#### Planting out the larger seedlings

At the end of last week I noticed that some of my seeds and plants had began to out grow their dishes, so decided to 'repot' them into larger containers.

After reading up on a few protocols and what the next step was I decided to make up a media using a recipe I had done previously :

**0.9 Murashige and Skoog medium
6g sugar
2ml liquid plant fertiliser
200 ml de - mineralised water
2g Agar**

I planted out 4 tomato seed and 2 cauliflower pieces which had long roots.
The tomato seeds where really long and stringy like, but surprisingly held themselves pretty well and were easy to insert into the media.
One of the cauliflower pieces had some black / dark green marks on it where it had been in contact with growing media over the time it had been in the petri dish.
