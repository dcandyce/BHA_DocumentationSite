![posting bacteria]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/lab work/posting bacteria.jpg)

My worry was how to send samples of bacteria, plants and mycelium back to the UK without causing problems for myself.
I decided to split the samples, posting half and take half in my luggage with me.

It was advised that I print all the product details of each specimen so if I was stopped or the package was opened I wasn't going to face any difficulties at border control.

I used this site [ATCC](https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/) and then searched for the organisms.
I printed a set for the bits i was posting and another set for the ones i was carrying on my person.
I had no problem going through the airport, they didn't stop me to check my luggage and the bits in the post arrived just fine!
