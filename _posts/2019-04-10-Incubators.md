I built up my modular incubator when i got home as i had a few samples of my plants to carry on growing.
It was still without the electronics as i haven't found the time to sort that issue out just yet. This meant, with the thin walls and few gaps in the incubator the temp would be warm or at a constant.

A few years back, for a project that speculated on domesticating lab meat i build a fake incubator.
It was based on the hacked incubators which use food insulated boxes. For it I used a polystyrene box and clad it in plywood to make it look like a more desirable and designed object. Seeing as it was just going to function as a prop and i wasn't confident in the electronics side of things i left that part out.
But now back at home i decided to get it out and use it - because of the polystyrene insulation it meant i wouldn't need to rush into trouble shooting the electronics for the incubator i already spent too much time on.

For the past 3 weeks i have used the more solid incubator to keep the plants in.
I do wonder how one is meant to keep one of these polystyrene incubator clean as it feels like the material would absorb anything that gets loose in there!
