One of the survivors was this cauliflower sample, but it out grew its dish and has pushed it open.
I feel like this is a poetic way of a final good bye from my plant sample.
It's broken free but can i no way thrive in the outside world because I forced it to live in the sterilised environment.

The prised cauliflower sample that got contaminated a few weeks back has grown into what looks like mycelium growing. I will need to get rid of it soon though.
And the second dish is a new batch of tobacco seeds that got mould - on a closer inspection the parafilm is damaged.
I went round inspecting the remaining samples to ensure their film was in tack and no mould.

Again its the ones in tubes that are still going strong!
