#### Making a microscope

![DIY microscope]({{site.baseurl}}/images/hacking equipment/webcammicroscope.JPG)

I made a microscope from a webcam, follow the steps on the biohack.github.io page.
It was pretty simple to make and im quite impressed with the quality.
The only issue im having is trying to focus the slide by moving the arm up and down - thats a bit clunky.
