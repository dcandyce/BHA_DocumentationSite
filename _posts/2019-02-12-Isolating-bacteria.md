#### Isolating Bacteria

![Samples to test]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lab work/Isolating bacteria1.JPG)

We took a sample of yogurt and yakult to isolate the lactose bacteria from and a sample of beer to isolate a sample of yeast from.
* To isolate the lactose bacteria we plated a 5 different dilution samples on plates made with _MRS AGAR_  (green) and also place a sample of the yogurt (100%) on a malt agar plate to see if any yeast is found in this culture of yogurt.
* To isolate the yeast bacteria from beer we did the same method as with the yogurt and yakult, but plated them on _MALT AGAR_ plates.
