When I joined the BHA I wasn't aware of how much I was going to learn.
Over the past 10 weeks I have gained so much knowledge and experience, and feel I have began to build up skills that will develop over the next few years into a real practise.
Doing this course has given me the tools to push my interest in biology to a medium that i can work with.
I hope to continue my experiments in plant tissue culture to create pieces that speak about my interest in stem cells and the future of biotechnology.

I also learnt to use GitHub and do a bit of coding which I always found a bit daunting and hard to get my head around. I now understand the importance of working on a skill to become familiar with it, this way it becomes a tool rather than a chore to use.

I was really lucky to have time in the lab to grow and tinker with many other living organisms, which i haven't documented on here but hope to add at a later stage.
I gained knowledge in making nutrient plates, looking after bacteria, exploring slime mould, experimenting with mycelium all along side pursuing my personal project for the BHA.

Another task I am super pleased to have been given was to help look after the lab. Even thought it was very much the day to day tasks of keeping it clean and making sure things were disposed of correctly I found myself really enjoying the time spent in the lab, with the radio on and preparing bits to work with.
