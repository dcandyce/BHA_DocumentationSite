#### Making the medium for my plant project

![making the medium]({{site.baseurl}}/images/project work/plant tissue culture.JPG)

Today i started the bio part of my project - I'm going to grow plants in dishes.
Starting with cauliflower, as it grows the fastest, i'll make clones of these.
It'll be interesting to see how they can be planted out.

I like the idea of collecting 'heritage plants' of my life and making a little clone garden with bits collected from all corners of the world.
