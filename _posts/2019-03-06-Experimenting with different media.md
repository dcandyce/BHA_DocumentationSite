title: Experimenting with different MS Media

#### Experimenting with different MS Media recipes

Feeling like my 2 previous solutions were a flop and having spent the weekend reading and watching videos about growing plant tissue I decided to try a few different recipes.

Based on the protocol found on the hackteria site : [Plants From Test Tubes](https://hackteria.org/wiki/images/6/64/Plants_From_Test_Tubes_Complete.pdf) I did 3 different media, each with something different :

* 1 Added 10ml of _coconut water_  and _0.02ml of 'PROFITO' plant fertiliser_

* 2 This solution was without any coconut water but _2ml plant fertiliser_

* 3 This media had _50% coconut water_ and no fertiliser

I then collected fresh seeds, Rosa Tomato and Yellow pepper to watch the growth of seeds from the medium i made previously as to not waste it.
