title: Plant tissue culture after traveling

![plants 1 week on]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/project work/1week after.jpg)

Not many of my plant tissue culture samples survived after the travel.
I think some of the para film tape wore off or there is a contamination in the new incubator. Though the samples that are in the tubes seem to be doing just fine, its just those in the petri dishes that have been effected.

Even stranger is a plate that i put a few samples of melon in - nothing has happened. no growth, no mould, nothing!

My treasured cauliflower became dislodged from the medium in transit and veyr quickly began to get mouldy.
The other dish is tobacco seeds - the para film on that was damaged and so it go contaminated quite fast too.
