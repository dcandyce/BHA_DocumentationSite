#### Weekend Growth

On friday I prepared my tissue culture in the most sterile environment I could manage, I autoclaved my tweezers, forceps and blades and wiped down everything with 70% ethanol before putting it in the sterile hood. I did find the sterile hood a bit small and dark for my work.
I have been thinking about tweaking the current design for when i manage to make my own one : making the top and bottom from acrylic so it's easier to see through and keep clean. I would also like to make a bigger one.

I followed the recipe for the Murashige Skoog (MS) media and the procedure from https://www.seed2stem.com/
I set up an 'incubation station' which i wiped down with 70% ethanol and set up grow lights on for the weekend -  giving the tissue culture 12 hours of light (this was excluding the natural sunlight that would come through to the lab).

Coming back on monday i noticed a few pieces were going a bit black along the edges.I think this may be because they burnt / had too much light, it was very sunny over the weekend.
I had throw away 3 tubes and will have to take a few specimen out of some of the dishes to ensure contamination doesn't spread.
