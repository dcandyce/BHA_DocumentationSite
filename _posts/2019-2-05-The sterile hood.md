# Our first piece of lab equipment

![sterile hood](https://github.com/dcandyce/dcandyce.github.io/blob/master/images/sterilehood3.jpg)

We learnt to use sketchUp, very basic and how to create a box with pieces that
fit inside of edges.We then were shown how to operate the laser cutter and cut
out the pieces for the sterile hood.
