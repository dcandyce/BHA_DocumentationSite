We had a run through on sketchUp : very basic but learnt to create a box that have edges that fir togather.
We were then shown how to operate the laser cutter and cut out the pieces for the sterile hood.
It took a lot longer on the laser cutter then expected so we only got round to puting the sterile hood together the following day.
