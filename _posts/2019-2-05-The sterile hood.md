# Our first piece of lab equipment

We had a run through on sketchUp : very basic but learnt to create a box that have edges that fit together and make 'p slots' for nuts and bolts.
We were then shown how to operate the laser cutter and cut out the pieces for the sterile hood.

It took a lot longer on the laser cutter then expected. We were cutting the parts for the hood from a large sheet of wood and the laser cutter gets weaker at one point so we had to figure out how to get a standard cut throughout.
 We only got round to putting the sterile hood together the following day and test it out a bit later.
