Dismantling the incubator was so quick and easy, done in less than 5 min!
It packed down to a very minimal size which i was quite surprised about. Unfortunately the pieces of wood i made for the frame was quite heavy, and i think in all it weighed close to 8kgs!!
I was close to leaving it all behind because I thought I'd manage to re-make another when i arrived back in London but thought other wise - the main reason i made it with such specific specs was so i could take it back with me and because i'd need it for my plants on the other side too.

In the end I took it with me, I paid for extra weight which made the cost of the incubator a bit more than i was hopping but I am gladI brought it back.

Back home and set the incubator up, ready to continue the plant growth.
