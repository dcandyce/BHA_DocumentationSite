# The first week at BHA6

Our second day we joined the other partner labs for lectures about the history of biohacking and the importance of Bio Safety.

Par gave us an introduction to the lab and safety rules we need to follow.
And how to clean out hands properly. He made us put a bright orange substance on our hands, rubbing it in and then wash it off.
It shows up under fluorescent light so we were able to see the places where bacteria could be left behind!
