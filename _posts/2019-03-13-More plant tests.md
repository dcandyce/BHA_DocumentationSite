Today I did a new batch of plant tissue and split the samples between the 3 different medium I made up last week.

I decided to go with a range :
* Daffodil
* Honeymelon
* Ginger
* Pineapple

I went with these as they were the freshest I had on hand and thought it would be interesting to see if how the plant grows make a difference to how it grows in the medium.
To sterilise the the samples I used 200ml of distilled water and 1 whole tablet of _Milton sterilise tablets_ (they are usually used for cold water sterilising baby bottles).
I left them in a closed glass container for Â±2 hrs.
While placing the samples in the medium I realised I didn't rinse the samples off - I hope this wont be a problem with growth.

**Daffodil**
They grow from a bulb and usually grow year after year.
I took a sample of the petal, the stalk, the leaf and the stamen

**Honeymelon**
These are grown from seeds and produce sweet fruit.
I took a sample from the skin and some flesh.
I also had some seeds which I put in some media too.

**Ginger**
These grow underground like a root system and can sometimes start to propagate from a fresh piece left in the right environments.
They are quite wild and have read that its best to keep it in its own pot if you have it in the garden as it will take over fast.

**Pineapple**
From experience I know you can grow a plant but drying out and water propagating the top of the fruit - not sure about the seeds.
So I took a tissue sample from the leaf and the bottom of the crown.

I look forward to see how the different samples grow in the slightly different medium
