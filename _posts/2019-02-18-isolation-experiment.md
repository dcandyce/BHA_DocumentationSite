#### Isolation experiment from last week

![Isolation plates]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lab work/Lactose isolation.JPG)

We checked on our isolation experiment from last week - the plates we did to isolate the lactose bacteria were more successful then the yeast isolation from the beer.
We also found that there is more _Lactobacillus_ in Yakult then in the yogurt that we used. There was also some yeast present in both yogurt and Yakult.

Later in the day two members replated the bacteria from a yakult plate so we will see how that grows.
