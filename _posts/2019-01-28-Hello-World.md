#### The start of the BioHack Academy

![The WAAG]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/WAAG.JPG)

I'm very excited to be part of the 6th BHA!
My mission for the next 10 weeks is to absorb and learn as much as i can about microbiology, how to grow and look after the organisms but also to build the lab equipment I will need to be able to continue these projects away fro the WAAG and a traditional lab.
