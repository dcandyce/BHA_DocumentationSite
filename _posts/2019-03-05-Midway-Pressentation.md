My project has a tile and a narrative now.
We have been set a 5min slot to present our project to all the other participants

* **1** "Whats the idea"
* **2** "How will you do it"
* **3** "How will you document it"



* **1** How can i navigate the BHA with all the information and skill sets?
Plants play a missive role in my life so i decided to use them as a platform to explore my new environment



* **2** Plant Tissue Culture and growing plants in a more sterile environment, as opposed to my adhock way of putting it in a glass of water and hoping for the best.
Also designing and making a personalise incubator for myself



* **3** Like a baking note book, it is important to record and write mistakes, finding, process, problems and failures.
I'll document it in a lab book and on here
