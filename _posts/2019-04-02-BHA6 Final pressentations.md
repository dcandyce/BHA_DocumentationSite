Today we all presented our final projects.
Our partner labs from Tokyo and Seoul joined, as well as a June who is doing it remotely in Philadelphia.

The presentations can been watched on the [Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/328160971) as it was all recorded.

It was great to see what everyone got up to and what can be achieved in 10 weeks!
