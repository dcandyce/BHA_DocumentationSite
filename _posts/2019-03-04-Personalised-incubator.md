title: Designing my incubator
---


#### Personal growing chamber

One thing i set out to make, equipment wise, was the incubator.
After weeks of not being able to commit i decided that today is the day to just go for it.
I had previously spent some time thinking about what my incubator will be used for and had some particular specs it needed, such as
* it needs to heat
* it needs to allow light in / have grow lights (to grow the plant tissue)
* it needs to be dark to be able to grow other bacteria and mycelium in
* it needs to be taken apart easily to travel as i want to take it back to London with me for minimal cost.
* and it should _not_ cost a lot to make **<--- most important**

I built the circuit, following the fritzing document, but haven't tested with all the components yet.

 I finally committed, did a model yesterday.
 To sold the dark and light issue and the fact that it needs to be taken apart i will create a slot-together system for it all to fit in place.
 2 or 3 sides can be clear (made from 3ml polycarbonate) or replaced with ply

 I bought the wood today to make the slotting system but have nothign to cut the slots from here in the workshop - so will have to rethink how to make the slots.

 Im looking forward to having my own incubator _i really hope it works!_
